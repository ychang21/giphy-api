### Gifs are fun and entertaining little snippets of videos that all people can enjoy. These days people make gifs out of all sorts of video content to either spread an important message or just for pure entertainment value. This app is cartoon themed and will generate 10 different gifs of the cartoon title chosen. You can even enter in your own cartoon that you would like to view. The gif rating will also generate with it so that the viewer is aware if the content is appropriate. The gifs will appear on screen as still pictures but upon clicking the gifs they will animate. If the user would like to stop the animation they could simply click on the gif, and it will be still again.

## Instructions
On the page, either click on a button with the cartoon name you would like to view or enter in your own. If you choose to enter in your own cartoon name a button will appear on the page. Click on the newly made button and 10 gifs related to that button will appear.

The gifs will appear as still images at first. Simply click on the gifs and they will animate. Click the same gif again and the image will be still again.
